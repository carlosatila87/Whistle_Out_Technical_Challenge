Whistleout .NET Engineer Technical Task
=======================================

To perform this challenge I created a Search Service (SearchMovie) to be injected on MoviesController.

To work properly you have to set the APIKEY on appsetings.json adding one more propertie as below.

  "OMDB": {
    "ApiKey": "YOUR API KEY"
  }

The reason I created the service was to centralize API calls in one object and also to get Configuation Properties (API KEY) in just one place.

Missing points:

- Tests
- CSS Refining
- React Component

I hope it is satisfactory.

Thanks.
